Hide Category Plugin for Question2Answer
=================================================

This is a small plugin for [Question2Answer](http://www.question2answer.org). It excludes a particular category from the activity page.


Installation & Usage
-------------------------------------------------

1. Download and extract the files to a subfolder inside the `qa-plugins` folder of your Q2A installation. Be sure to use the right name ; if you downloaded it from GitHub you'll have to remove the `-master` suffix from the folder name. Otherwise you'll get a 'file not found' error.

2. Go to Admin > Plugins, enable the plugin, and enter the slug of the category you want to hide.
